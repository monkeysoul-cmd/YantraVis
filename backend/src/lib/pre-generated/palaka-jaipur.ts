  description: "<h3>📜 Purpose</h3><ul><li>The Palaka Yantra is a simple, often handheld, rectangular board instrument.</li><li>It can be used for various calculations, such as determining the time from the altitude of the sun, or finding the height of objects.</li></ul><h3>🏛️ Historical Significance</h3><ul><li>Represents a class of simple, portable astronomical instruments, precursors to the modern sextant or astrolabe.</li><li>It demonstrates how basic geometric principles can be used for complex astronomical calculations.</li></ul><h3>✨ Fun Fact</h3><p>Despite its simplicity, a Palaka Yantra, when used with a plumb line and sighting pin, could be a surprisingly versatile tool in the hands of a skilled astronomer.</p><h3>🌌 Cosmic Connection</h3><p>Beyond its precise measurements, this instrument embodies the deep philosophical connection between humanity and the cosmos. In traditional Indian astronomy, the alignment of such monumental structures with the heavens was believed to reflect the profound interconnectedness of the terrestrial and celestial realms, acting as a physical manifestation of Vedic astronomical principles.</p>",

    costEstimate: 'Very low. This is the simplest and cheapest instrument to construct, often used for educational purposes or as a personal tool for an astronomer.',
    accuracy: 'Low to moderate. Its accuracy is limited by its small size and the steadiness of the observer\'s hand. It is more of a demonstrational tool than a precision instrument.',
    orientation: {
      trueNorthAngle: 'Orientation depends on the measurement being taken. For time-telling, it needs to be aligned with the sun and the local vertical (plumb line).',
      magneticDeclination: "Not directly relevant for most of the instrument's functions, which rely on direct sighting and local gravity (plumb line).",
      foundationNotes: 'No foundation is required as it is a small or handheld instrument. A stable, level surface to place it on is sufficient.',
      toleranceGuidance: 'The board must be perfectly flat and the edges perfectly square. The accuracy of the engraved scales is the most critical factor.',
