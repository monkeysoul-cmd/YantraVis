    costEstimate: 'Very low. This is the simplest and cheapest instrument to construct, often used for educational purposes or as a personal tool for an astronomer.',
    accuracy: 'Low to moderate. Its accuracy is limited by its small size and the steadiness of the observer\'s hand. It is more of a demonstrational tool than a precision instrument.',
    orientation: {
      trueNorthAngle: 'Orientation depends on the measurement being taken. For time-telling, it needs to be aligned with the sun and the local vertical (plumb line).',
      magneticDeclination: "Not directly relevant for most of the instrument's functions, which rely on direct sighting and local gravity (plumb line).",
      foundationNotes: 'No foundation is required as it is a small or handheld instrument. A stable, level surface to place it on is sufficient.',
      toleranceGuidance: 'The board must be perfectly flat and the edges perfectly square. The accuracy of the engraved scales is the most critical factor.',
