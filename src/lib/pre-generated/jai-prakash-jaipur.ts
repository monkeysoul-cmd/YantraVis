  description: "<h3>üìú Purpose</h3><ul><li>The Jai Prakash Yantra is a 'celestial map' that provides a direct, inverted image of the sky overhead.</li><li>It is used to determine the position of the sun, and by extension, other celestial bodies. It can determine the local time, sun's declination, and the zodiac sign.</li></ul><h3>üèõÔ∏è Historical Significance</h3><ul><li>One of the most complex and versatile instruments at the Jantar Mantar observatories.</li><li>It is often composed of two complementary hemispherical bowls, allowing an observer to be in one while observing the other.</li></ul><h3>‚ú® Fun Fact</h3><p>The pathways and markings inside the bowl are a map of the celestial coordinate system. An observer can stand inside and their head becomes the reference point for aligning with celestial bodies using a cross-wire stretched across the top.</p>",

    costEstimate: 'Extremely high, potentially one of the most expensive instruments due to the vast amount of precision marble work and engraving required to map the celestial coordinates accurately.',
    accuracy: 'Provides very high accuracy in determining the position of celestial objects, often to within a few arcminutes. The precision is limited by the quality of the engraved lines.',
    orientation: {
      trueNorthAngle: 'The North-South and East-West axes of the bowl must be perfectly aligned with the cardinal directions. The rim of the bowl represents the horizon and must be perfectly level.',
      magneticDeclination: "The magnetic declination for Jaipur (approx. 0.8¬∞ East) is vital for aligning the instrument's coordinate system with the true celestial poles and equator.",
      foundationNotes: 'Requires an exceptionally stable and perfectly level foundation to ensure the hemispherical bowl does not tilt or warp, which would render the entire celestial map inaccurate.',
      toleranceGuidance: 'The most critical aspect is the precision of the concave surface and the engraved coordinate lines (azimuth and altitude). Any error in the hemisphere\'s shape will distort the sky map.',
