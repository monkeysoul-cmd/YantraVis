  description: "<h3>üìú Purpose</h3><ul><li>The Digamsa Yantra is used to measure the azimuth (horizontal angle or direction) of celestial objects.</li><li>It consists of a central pillar surrounded by two concentric circular walls.</li></ul><h3>üèõÔ∏è Historical Significance</h3><ul><li>An essential instrument for accurately mapping the position of stars and planets relative to the observer's horizon.</li><li>Its design allows for readings to be taken from any direction.</li></ul><h3>‚ú® Fun Fact</h3><p>A string is stretched from the top of the central pillar to the outer wall. The point where the string crosses the inner wall indicates the azimuth of the celestial object being sighted.</p>",

    costEstimate: 'High, due to the need for two perfectly circular walls and a perfectly vertical central pillar. The precision of the circular construction is paramount.',
