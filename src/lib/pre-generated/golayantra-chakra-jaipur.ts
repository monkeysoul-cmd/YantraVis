  description: "<h3>üìú Purpose</h3><ul><li>The Golayantra Chakra is an armillary sphere, a model of the celestial sphere.</li><li>It is used to demonstrate the motion of the stars and to determine celestial coordinates.</li></ul><h3>üèõÔ∏è Historical Significance</h3><ul><li>Armillary spheres have been used across many cultures, from ancient Greece to India and China.</li><li>They serve as both a scientific instrument and an educational tool to visualize the cosmos.</li></ul><h3>‚ú® Fun Fact</h3><p>The rings of the Golayantra represent key celestial circles, such as the celestial equator, the ecliptic, and the meridians, making it a 3D map of the heavens.</p>",

    costEstimate: 'High, especially if constructed from traditional materials like bronze. The cost is driven by the skilled metalwork and precision engraving required for the rings.',
    accuracy: 'Primarily an educational and demonstrational tool. Its measurement accuracy is lower than dedicated instruments but is invaluable for understanding celestial mechanics.',
    orientation: {
      trueNorthAngle: 'The main axis of the sphere must be aligned with the celestial poles, meaning it must be parallel to the Earth\'s axis and point towards true north.',
      magneticDeclination: "Correcting for magnetic declination (approx. 0.8¬∞ East for Jaipur) is essential for the instrument's primary axis to be a true representation of the sky.",
      foundationNotes: 'Requires a sturdy, level pedestal that can support the weight of the metal sphere and allow for smooth rotation without wobble.',
      toleranceGuidance: 'The rings must be perfectly circular and concentric. The angles between the rings (e.g., the ecliptic angle of 23.5 degrees) must be manufactured with high precision.',
