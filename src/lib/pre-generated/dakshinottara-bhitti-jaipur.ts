  description: "<h3>üìú Purpose</h3><ul><li>The Dakshinottara Bhitti Yantra is a meridian wall instrument specifically used for measuring the altitude of celestial objects at their highest point (noon).</li><li>It helps determine the sun's maximum and minimum altitude during the year, which is used to find the solstices.</li></ul><h3>üèõÔ∏è Historical Significance</h3><ul><li>A specialized version of the Bhitti Yantra, it's a key instrument for tracking the annual movement of the sun.</li><li>Observations from this instrument were vital for calendar-making and predicting seasons.</li></ul><h3>‚ú® Fun Fact</h3><p>The name 'Dakshinottara' refers to the South-North movement of the sun throughout the year, which this instrument is designed to track.</p>",

    costEstimate: 'Extremely high. Similar to a Bhitti Yantra, its cost is driven by the precision of its construction and alignment rather than complexity.',
    accuracy: 'Very high for measuring solar altitude at noon. This accuracy is fundamental for determining the precise dates of the solstices and equinoxes.',
    orientation: {
      trueNorthAngle: 'Like the standard Bhitti Yantra, this wall must be perfectly aligned with the local North-South meridian to function correctly.',
      magneticDeclination: "Correcting for magnetic declination (approx. 0.8¬∞ East for Jaipur) is a mandatory first step for aligning the wall to true north.",
      foundationNotes: 'A rock-solid foundation is non-negotiable. Any settling would change the altitude readings and compromise all data collected over years of observation.',
      toleranceGuidance: 'The wall must be perfectly plumb (vertical) and its surface perfectly flat. The altitude scale, usually an engraved quadrant arc, must be precise to arcminutes.',
